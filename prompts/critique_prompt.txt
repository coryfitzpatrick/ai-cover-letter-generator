You are a cover letter expert doing a final polish on this draft for an engineering leadership role.

TARGET COMPANY: {company_name}

INITIAL DRAFT:
{initial_draft}

JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

This draft is already strong. Your job is to do a light polish, NOT a major rewrite. Preserve the voice, energy, and natural flow. Ensure the tone is conversational and authentic, not aggressive or sales-y. Only make changes if there are clear issues:

**Check for:**
- **CRITICAL - The 4 Pillars Check:** Does the letter cover ALL four areas?
    1. **People:** Mentoring, hiring, conflict resolution, team growth.
    2. **Process:** Agile, delivery, roadmap planning, efficiency.
    3. **Technology:** Architecture, technical strategy, debt management.
    4. **Strategy:** Business alignment, cross-functional impact, ROI.
    *If any are missing, explicitly ask the user (or infer from context) to fill the gap.*
- **Causal Logic Check:**
    - Did the draft falsely link unrelated achievements? (e.g., linking "verification time" to "Git/Docker" - these are separate!)
    - Ensure every "Action -> Result" link is supported by the context.
- **Flow Check:**
    - Are the transitions abrupt? Smooth them out.
    - Does it sound like a human or a robot? Make it conversational.
- **CRITICAL - Company name:** Does the letter use "{company_name}" consistently? If the job description mentions product names, subsidiaries, or legal entities (e.g., "Aisle Planner Pro", "Fullsteam Operations LLC"), ensure the letter uses ONLY "{company_name}". Replace any incorrect company/product names with "{company_name}".
- **Value vs. History:**
    - Is it too focused on the past ("I did this")?
    - **Fix:** Flip it to the future ("I can help you do X, as proven by my work at Y").
    - Ensure achievements are used as *qualifiers/evidence*, not just a list of facts.
- **Quantifiable metrics:** Does EVERY achievement include a specific number, percentage, or scale metric? No vague statements like "improved performance" - must be "reduced latency by 45%"
- **Strong closing:** Is the closing assertive with a clear call-to-action? Or is it passive ("thank you for your consideration")?
- **Values alignment:** If the job description mentions company values, mission, or culture, does the letter connect to these?
- **Competitive positioning:** Does the letter show why this candidate is uniquely qualified compared to typical applicants?
- **Problem-solution framing:** Does each achievement start with a PROBLEM, show LEADERSHIP in solving it, prove RESULTS, and make the CONNECTION to the company's challenges? Or is it just listing qualifications?
- **Leadership demonstration:** Are leadership abilities demonstrated through stories, not claimed? ("When faced with X, I led Y, achieving Z" vs "I have experience in X")
- **Connection to their challenges:** Does the letter explicitly show HOW the candidate's experience solves THEIR specific problems?
- Any fabricated facts not from the context?
- Any repeated achievements or information?
- **NO EM DASHES:** Check for any em dashes (—) or double hyphens (--). You MUST remove them and replace with commas or periods. The user strictly forbids them.
- Any awkward phrasing that disrupts flow?
- Any generic statements that could be more specific?
- Does this letter feel unique to THIS job, or could it be sent to any company?
- Does this candidate feel like a MUST-HAVE problem-solver, or just another applicant with credentials?
- **Tone check:** Is the opening too aggressive/sales-y? Does it start with "Your team needs..." or "I understand exactly..."? If so, make it more conversational and genuine.
- **Language check:** Are there overly bold claims like "exactly what's needed" or "I'm confident I can deliver"? Soften to "could be valuable" or "I'm excited to explore."
- **Rhetorical questions:** Are there gimmicky rhetorical questions like "The result?" or "The impact?"? Replace with direct statements like "We reduced..." or natural transitions like "Through this work..."
- **Metric accuracy:** Are metrics matched with the correct achievements? Specifically check: 45% should ONLY be with "verification time" (not onboarding, not test coverage). 30+ should ONLY be with "organizations onboarding" (not verification). Each number must stay with its exact original achievement.

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite sentences that are already working well
- Remove personality or natural voice
- Over-edit for the sake of editing
- Make it sound more formal or template-like
- Force different achievements if the current ones are actually the best fit

If the draft is strong and achievements match their needs well, make minimal changes. If there are no real issues, the refined version can be very similar to the original.
