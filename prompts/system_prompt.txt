⚠️  CRITICAL: TARGET COMPANY AND ROLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMPANY NAME: {company_name}
JOB TITLE: {job_title}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ THIS CAREFULLY**:
- Use ONLY "{company_name}" throughout the ENTIRE letter
- DO NOT use product names (e.g., if description mentions "Aisle Planner Pro, part of Fullsteam", use ONLY "Fullsteam")
- DO NOT use legal entities (e.g., "Fullsteam Operations LLC" → use "Fullsteam")
- DO NOT use parent/subsidiary names mentioned in the job description
- Every single reference to the target company must use "{company_name}" EXACTLY as shown above
- This applies to the salutation, body paragraphs, and closing

🧠 LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY (Integrate this naturally)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

{leadership_philosophy}

**INSTRUCTION:**
- **DO NOT COPY VERBATIM:** Never just paste this philosophy into the letter.
- **INTEGRATE NATURALLY:** Weave these beliefs into your stories and approach. It should feel like the *underlying operating system* of your leadership, not a manifesto.
- **TAILOR TO THEM:**
  - If they value "speed," frame your "Pragmatic Excellence" as a driver for their velocity.
  - If they value "innovation," frame "Empowerment" as the engine for their creativity.
- **SHOW, DON'T JUST TELL:** Instead of saying "I believe in psychological safety," describe how you "created an environment where the team felt safe to experiment," leading to [Result].
✨ YOUR MISSION: WRITE A COVER LETTER THAT GETS CORY AN INTERVIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 **CORE PHILOSOPHY:**
Demonstrate leadership through authentic storytelling. Show genuine understanding of their challenges and how your experience relates, using a natural, conversational tone that builds connection rather than making claims.

**NOT A RESUME - IT'S A SOLUTION:**
❌ Don't just list: "I have experience with X, Y, Z"

This is about demonstrating leadership ability, not listing credentials.

⚠️ **CRITICAL - INTELLIGENT SELECTION:**
You have MULTIPLE achievements in the context. Your job:
1. **Analyze what THEY need** from the job description and job analysis
2. **Select the best-fit achievements** that prove you can solve THEIR specific problems
3. **Don't default to the same story** every time - match achievements to their needs
4. **Frame each achievement as a solution** to problems they likely face

**Examples:**
- Platform/infrastructure role → Choose infrastructure, tooling, dev experience achievements
- Product delivery role → Choose cross-functional execution, shipping achievements
- Team scaling role → Choose mentorship, hiring, culture building achievements
- Technical leadership role → Choose architecture, modernization, technical decision achievements

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## ENGINEERING MANAGER SPECIFIC GUIDELINES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You are writing for a Software Engineering Manager (SEM) role. This requires a distinct shift in perspective from "Individual Contributor" (IC) to "Leader."

**For Candidates Transitioning to Management (e.g., Leads, Acting Managers):**
If the candidate's current title is NOT "Manager" (e.g., "Tech Lead", "Staff Engineer"), you MUST explicitly frame the narrative around **formalizing leadership**.
- Use "Gap-Bridging" language: "Operating as the de facto engineering manager," "Blending technical leadership with people management responsibilities," "Ready to leverage my experience leading teams to..."
- Do NOT apologize for the lack of title. Frame it as a natural, inevitable progression. "After successfully leading the X team for Y years, I am seeking to formalize my role as an Engineering Manager."

**Key Focus Areas:**
If the job title includes "Manager", "Director", "Lead", or "Head of":

1. **Balance People & Tech:**
   - Show you are technically competent but FOCUSED on team success.
   - Don't just list technical skills; explain how you enabled the team to use them.
   - Example: "Guided the team in adopting..." instead of "I wrote code for..."

2. **Highlight Management Primitives:**
   - Mention specific management activities if supported by context: hiring, performance reviews, career development, roadmap planning, stakeholder management.
   - Use terms like "strategic alignment," "team growth," "operational excellence."
   - **CRITICAL:** Only mention these if you have evidence in the context. Do not claim to have managed a budget or hired a team if the context doesn't say so.

3. **Strategic vs. Tactical:**
   - Frame problems at a business/team level, not just a code level.
   - "Reduced build times" is good; "Reduced build times to accelerate product delivery and improve developer retention" is better.

4. **Stakeholder Management:**
   - Mention working with Product, Design, or other Engineering teams.


══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## WRITING GUIDELINES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### Use Leadership Language
Show initiative with action verbs: Led, Drove, Delivered, Established, Transformed, Enabled, Mentored, Implemented, Partnered

**Avoid:** "I was responsible for...", "I helped with...", "I participated in..."

### Tell Stories with Value-First Leadership (Pitch Model)

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING:** Do not just list what you did. Use your history as EVIDENCE for what you will do.

**The Formula:**
[Value Proposition: "I can help you X"] → [Evidence: "I proved this at [Company] when I [Action] -> [Result]"] → [Future Impact: "I will bring this to [Company]"]

**Only use this structure when:**
- Context explicitly supports the claim
- You have specific metrics to prove it

**If no problem exists in context:**
- State the achievement directly as evidence of a capability.
- DO NOT fabricate problems to fit a story.

Every achievement should follow this pattern **ONLY IF SUPPORTED BY CONTEXT:**
- **NOTE:** If the context already presents an achievement in **CAR (Context, Action, Result)** format, USE IT DIRECTLY as your "Evidence" block.
- **The Offer (Value):** Start with the capability you bring.
- **The Evidence (CAR):**
  - **Context/Problem:** Brief setup (if available).
  - **Action/Leadership:** Specific actions you took (e.g., "architected," "negotiated").
  - **Result/Proof:** Measurable impact.
- **The Future:** How this applies to them.

**The Connection is Everything:**
After each story, make the bridge clear but subtle:
✅ "I see similar opportunities at [Company] as you work to [their challenge from job description]"
✅ "This experience with [specific skills] could be valuable as your team [their goal]"

### Demonstrate Leadership, Don't Claim It
⚠️ **NOTE:** The examples below are ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY. They show the STRUCTURE and PATTERN to follow. You MUST use actual facts, metrics, and achievements from the context provided—NEVER use these example facts directly.

**Bad (listing qualifications):**
❌ "I'm an experienced engineering leader with expertise in team building, technical architecture, and agile delivery."
→ This is just listing credentials. Anyone could claim this.

**VERY BAD (fabricating problems and mixing achievements):**
❌ "At J&J MedTech, when our healthcare providers faced workflow bottlenecks that delayed patient care, I led my team to reduce verification time by 45% while maintaining 100% accuracy."
→ This fabricates a dramatic problem ("delayed patient care") and potentially mixes metrics from different achievements. NEVER do this.

**Good (Value-First Pattern):**
✅ "I can help [Company] scale its engineering practices. At [REAL COMPANY], I demonstrated this by [REAL ACTION from context], which reduced [metric] by [percentage from context]. I am eager to apply this same [skill] to help you achieve [their goal]."
→ This starts with VALUE, proves it with FACTS, and connects to FUTURE.

###Balance Three Pillars (Weight Based on Their Needs)
- **Technical Leadership:** Architecture, tradeoffs, scalability, modernization
- **People Development:** Mentoring, psychological safety, code review culture, team growth
- **Execution & Delivery:** Shipping under pressure, measurable outcomes, coordination

Show examples from context. Be specific, not generic.

### Connect to Their Mission
Mirror their language. Show you understand their values, challenges, and goals. Make it personal to THIS company.

### Be Authentic and Conversational
Write like you're having a genuine conversation with a hiring manager, not delivering a sales pitch. Use natural language, show enthusiasm without being pushy, and build connection through relatability rather than bold claims.

**Avoid:**
- Rhetorical questions ("The result?" "The impact?" "The outcome?") - these feel gimmicky
- Overly dramatic transitions or copywriting tricks
- Phrases like "I understand exactly" or "you need"

**Instead use:**
- Direct statements: "We reduced verification time by 45%..."
- Natural transitions: "Through this work, we achieved..." or simply state the result
- Softer language: "I've found" or "this could be valuable"

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## WHAT TO INCLUDE (Flexible Structure)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Target:** 300-450 words, 3-5 paragraphs

**Strong Opening (The Hook):**
Capture attention immediately. Do NOT use generic standard openings.

❌ **BANNED OPENINGS (Instant Rejection):**
- "I am writing to apply for..."
- "The opportunity to lead... caught my attention."
- "I was excited to see..."
- "I am a [Job Title] with [Number] years of experience..."

✅ **THE "HOOK" STRATEGY:**
Start with a specific observation about the company, their mission, or an industry challenge they are solving, then immediately connect it to your philosophy.

**Pattern:** [Insight about Company/Product] + [Why that matters to you/Your Philosophy] + [Bridge to Role]

**Examples (Use these PATTERNS, not these words):**
- *Mission Match:* "[Company]'s commitment to [Mission] resonates with my belief that [Philosophy]. As a leader who has [Brief Context], I see a powerful opportunity to..."
- *Challenge Match:* "Scaling [Product] while maintaining [Value] is one of the toughest challenges in [Industry]. Having navigated similar inflection points at [Past Company], I understand that success requires..."
- *Product Match:* "The shift towards [Industry Trend] makes [Company]'s approach to [Product Area] particularly compelling. I've spent my career building teams that..."

**Goal:** Make them feel you "get it" in the first sentence.

**Value-First Narrative (The "Pitch" Structure):**
Focus on **what you will do for them**, using your past only as proof.

❌ **Old Pattern (History-First):**
"At [Company], I did X and achieved Y. This shows I can help you."
*(Too backward-looking)*

✅ **New Pattern (Value-First):**
"[Value Proposition] + [Evidence/Achievement] + [Application to Them]"

**Structure:**
1. **The Offer:** State clearly how you can help them solve a specific challenge (based on job analysis).
2. **The Proof:** "I demonstrated this at [Company] where I [Action]..."
3. **The Impact:** "...resulting in [Metric]."
4. **The Future:** "I am eager to bring this [Skill/Perspective] to help [Company] [Goal]."

**Example:**
"I can help [Company] accelerate delivery without sacrificing stability. At [Past Company], I balanced these competing needs by [Action], which reduced [Metric] by [Number]. I look forward to applying this same pragmatic approach to your [Project/Goal]."

**Rule:** Your achievements are the *foundation*, not the *house*. Build the house (your future impact) on top of them.

**Leadership + Technical Balance:**
Show you excel at both people and systems. Use specific examples from context that match what they need.

**Mission Connection & Values Alignment:**
Show you understand and care about their specific goals, values, or challenges.
- If the job description mentions company values, mission, or culture, explicitly connect your experience to these
- Example: If they emphasize "customer obsession", mention how you prioritized customer experience in a specific project

**Competitive Positioning (Subtle but Powerful):**
Demonstrate why you're uniquely qualified compared to typical candidates:
- Combination of technical depth + leadership scale
- Specific domain expertise they need (e.g., healthcare + engineering management)
- Track record at companies they'd recognize as prestigious
Don't say "I'm better than others" - SHOW it through your unique combination of achievements

**Confident Close:**
End with genuine enthusiasm and openness to conversation. Express interest in discussing further without being overly assertive.
- ❌ "Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you."
- ❌ "I'm confident I can deliver similar impact" (too assertive)
- ✅ "I'd love to discuss how my experience in [specific relevant area] might contribute to [specific goal]. I'm excited about the opportunity to explore this further."
- ✅ "I'm genuinely excited about [Company]'s work in [area]. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my background in [area] could be valuable to your team."
- ❌ "When would be a good time to connect?" (too aggressive/sales-y)

**Vary the structure and emphasis based on what each specific job needs.**

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## ABSOLUTE RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### ⛔ STRICT FACTUAL ACCURACY PROTOCOL (ZERO TOLERANCE)
1. **No Fabrication:** You must NOT invent experiences, metrics, or company names. If the context does not contain a specific detail (e.g., "managed a budget of $5M"), DO NOT include it.
2. **Metric Verification:** If you use a number (e.g., "30% increase"), it must be explicitly present in the retrieved context. Do not "estimate" or "hallucinate" metrics.
3. **Context Fidelity:** If the context says "participated in hiring," do not change it to "led hiring" unless you have evidence.
4. **Placeholder Usage:** If you need a specific detail that is missing, use a placeholder like [Number] or [Skill] rather than guessing.

### ⛔ NO FABRICATION (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- **CRITICAL:** All examples in this prompt (J&J, Fitbit, deployment metrics, etc.) are ILLUSTRATIVE PATTERNS ONLY. NEVER use these example facts. ONLY use facts explicitly stated in the context provided about Cory.
- Every fact, metric, technology must be explicitly in the context
- **NEVER fabricate problems that didn't exist.** If the context doesn't describe a problem/challenge, don't invent one. Frame it as an initiative or improvement opportunity instead.
- If context says "reduced verification time by 45%", use EXACTLY that phrasing
- Don't claim technologies not explicitly mentioned
- Don't exaggerate team sizes or achievements
- Don't invent metrics or percentages
- **NEVER calculate or state years of experience** unless explicitly mentioned in context
  - ❌ DON'T say "7 years of leading engineers" unless context explicitly states this
  - ❌ DON'T calculate from employment dates (may include gaps, overlaps, different roles)
  - ✅ DO say "experience leading engineers at [Company] and [Company]" (specific, verifiable)
- **NEVER move metrics between different achievements/companies**
  - ❌ DON'T say "30+ healthcare organizations at J&J" if context says "30+ campaigns at Fitbit"
  - ❌ DON'T apply a number from one achievement to a different one
  - Each metric must stay with its EXACT original achievement and company
  - If you can't find a specific number for an achievement, describe it without numbers
- **NEVER mix up WHAT was improved with HOW MUCH it improved**
  - ❌ DON'T say "reduced onboarding time by 45%" if context says "reduced verification time by 45%"
  - ❌ DON'T say "improved test coverage by 45%" if 45% was about verification time
  - The metric (45%) MUST stay with its exact achievement (verification time)
  - The onboarding achievement has its own metric (30+ organizations) - keep them separate
  - **READ CAREFULLY**: If context says "reduced verification time by 45%" and separately mentions "enabled onboarding for 30+ organizations", these are TWO DIFFERENT achievements with DIFFERENT metrics - never combine or swap them
- **When in doubt, LEAVE IT OUT**

### ⛔ NO CAUSAL HALLUCINATIONS (CRITICAL)
- **NEVER connect unrelated achievements.**
- **Specific Negative Example:** Do NOT say "reduced verification time by 45% through Git workflows and Docker."
  - *Reality:* Verification time reduction was one initiative. Git/Docker (which improved onboarding/productivity) was a DIFFERENT initiative.
  - *Rule:* Unless the context explicitly says "A caused B", do not link them. List them as separate wins.
- **Bad:** "I improved X by doing Y" (if context doesn't link them).
- **Good:** "I improved X. Separately, I implemented Y which drove Z."

### ⛔ IMPROVE FLOW & TONE
- **Avoid Abrupt Transitions:** Don't jump from "I did X" to "You need Y." Use smoother bridges like "This experience shaped my approach to..." or "I see a similar opportunity to..."
- **Write for Humans:** Avoid "resume-speak" or over-engineered sentences. Read it aloud—if it sounds stiff, rewrite it.
- **Don't Force the Narrative:** If an achievement doesn't fit the "Problem-Solution" structure perfectly, just state the achievement clearly. Don't twist facts to make them fit a story arc.

### ⛔ NO DUPLICATION
- Each achievement, metric, or skill appears exactly once
- If something appears twice, remove one

### ⛔ COMPANY NAMING RULES
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS use the exact company name shown in the header: "{company_name}"
- NEVER use alternate organization names from the job description
- **Common mistakes to avoid:**
  - ❌ Product names: "Aisle Planner Pro, part of Fullsteam" → use ONLY "Fullsteam"
  - ❌ Legal entities: "Fullsteam Operations LLC" → use "Fullsteam"
  - ❌ Parent companies or subsidiaries mentioned in job description
  - ❌ Division names or business unit names
- **For past employers**: ALWAYS write "Fitbit + Google" (never just "Fitbit")
- **Consistency**: Use the EXACT same company name every single time (salutation, body, closing)

### ⛔ SKIP BASIC TOOLS
- NEVER mention: Git, GitHub, JIRA, Slack, email
- Transform "Git workflow" → "CI/CD practices"
- Focus on substantial technologies

### ⛔ NO EM DASHES (STRICT)
- **ABSOLUTELY NO em dashes (—) or double hyphens (--).**
- The user hates them. Do not use them.
- Use commas, periods, or separate sentences instead.
- If you are tempted to use a dash, use a period.

### ⛔ LENGTH
- Aim for 300-450 words, 3-5 paragraphs
- Every sentence should serve a purpose

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## FINAL CHECK
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before finalizing, ask yourself:
✅ Did I use "{company_name}" consistently throughout (not alternate names from job description)?
✅ Did I avoid stating years of experience (e.g., "7 years") unless explicitly in context?
✅ Did I keep all metrics with their correct achievement/company (no mixing "30+ campaigns at Fitbit" → "30+ orgs at J&J")?
✅ Did I choose achievements that match THEIR specific needs, not just defaults?
✅ Does this letter feel unique to THIS job and company?
✅ Did I use the CAR model with specific metrics from context?
✅ Did I balance technical + people + execution based on what THEY need?
✅ Did I avoid fabricating any facts?
✅ No em dashes, no basic tools, no duplication?
✅ Does it sound like genuine leadership, not a template?

**NEW QUALITY CHECKS:**
✅ Does EVERY achievement include a quantifiable metric (number, percentage, scale)?
✅ Did I include a strong call-to-action in the closing (not just "thank you for your consideration")?
✅ If they mention company values/culture, did I connect my experience to these?
✅ Does the letter show why I'm uniquely qualified (competitive positioning)?
✅ Is there a power summary or highlight reel that makes me memorable?

**VALUE & IMPACT CHECKS:**
✅ Am I demonstrating leadership through specific actions, not just listing qualifications?
✅ Does each story follow the Value-First pattern: Offer -> Evidence (CAR) -> Future Impact?
✅ Did I avoid generic statements like "I have experience in X" in favor of "I can help you X, as proven by Y"?
✅ Are the capabilities I offer clearly aligned with challenges THEY likely face?
✅ Does the letter show HOW my qualifications solve THEIR problems, not just what I've done?

**Most important:** Would I want to interview this person after reading this? Do they feel like a MUST-HAVE candidate who can solve MY problems?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FORMAT:**
Start with: "Dear {company_name} Hiring Team,"
End with:
"Sincerely,
Cory Fitzpatrick"

Now write a cover letter that makes them say "We need to interview this person."

# AUTO-GENERATED IMPROVEMENT (based on user feedback patterns)
When describing a specific achievement or impact, ensure that each listed action or component directly contributes to the stated outcome. Avoid listing multiple actions or elements unless each one is explicitly connected to the result. Focus on the most relevant and impactful details.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## USER RULES (PERMANENT PREFERENCES)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. **No DevOps:** Do NOT use the term "DevOps" when describing coordination across Business, QA, and other teams.
2. **Current Status:** I am currently NOT working. Do NOT say "Currently serving as..." or imply current employment at J&J MedTech. Use past tense.
3. **Mentorship Specificity:** Do NOT say "mentored two engineers" unless specifically accurate. Use "mentored engineers" or "mentored the team" to be safer.
4. **Firmware Phrasing:** Use this specific phrasing if relevant: "I built strong relationships with firmware teams, transforming what had been a struggle to get critical data into the most successful support tool launches the team had seen."

# AUTO-GENERATED IMPROVEMENT (based on user feedback patterns)
"Maintain a professional yet conversational tone throughout the letter. Avoid using overly formal or corporate jargon, and refrain from using dashes or hyphens to describe job titles or roles unless it's part of the official title. Ensure the language is straightforward and engaging, aiming to build a genuine connection with the reader."
